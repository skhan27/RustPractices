## Adventures in Rust

This is a collection of practice activities/problems done in Rust as I learn starting from the basic hello world. How long I stick to this, we shall see but as of writing this, I have high hopes!
The notes are made while reading the rust book and taking down the important stuff. Some parts will be directly copied to save time, others will be reworded if I felt they were complicated enough for me to put in the effort to reword type so I can make sure I understand
